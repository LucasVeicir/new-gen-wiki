    Kaiser is a handsome tall young man with light blue eyes and light blonde hair, accented by red eyeliner. His hairstyle includes a mullet with blue streaks at the ends and two deep blue rat-tails. He symbolizes blue rose tattoos on his neck, which transition into chain-like intertwined thorny stems down his left arm, culminating in a crown with a keyhole on his left hand. He is typically seen wearing his Bastard MÃ¼nchen #10 uniform, which features red and black with gold stripes, complemented by black and gold striped socks, sneakers, and a long-sleeved shirt.
