    Bunny is a tall, athletic young man with a lavender-colored hair and relatively large red irises. He also possesses two scars on his face; one vertical scar running down his right eye and one horizontal scar running across his right cheek and nose. He also has a scar on the left side of his neck. In his casual attire he dons a black cap with a rabbit's face on the front with matching scars, a button-less overcoat and a white T-shirt with the inscription “Solo Yo” (translated from Spanish - “Only I”). Complementing the outfit are light-colored straight cut jeans and black sneakers. On the pitch he is generally fitted in the FC Barcha Kit.
