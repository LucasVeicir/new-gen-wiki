Lorenzo is only focused on the strength of others and money. He strongly believes money makes the world go round and there is nothing in this world money can't obtain. He only acknowledges people with value attached to them, and even then, they have to be strong for him to give them any care. Even though he is overconfident, he is a team player whose team strongly trusts his abilities. He even realizes his role in the overall team formation and does not try to step out of it by doing his job perfectly and feeding the ball to their striker without issue.

His obsession with money stems from his upbringing; he was born into a miserable household and, after being abandoned by his parents, was forced to live in the streets. He spent his time swindling people out of their money for survival, but eventually, he lost hope in life and was ready to die. Fortunately, he was found by Snuffy, who offered him help in exchange for playing football with him, with Snuffy paying for his signature golden teeth. Ever since, he has gained immense respect for Snuffy, not hesitating to defend him after Baro called him a coward and rejected his proposal to succeed him. After Snuffy declares his resignation of retirement, Lorenzo offers Baro a gold tooth for the gratitude of seeing him happy.

    Lorenzo outside of the game can be quite cheerful and rowdy. He tends to make a mess of whatever he is eating, usually popcorn, and pays no mind to what others think of his display. He is kind and supports his teammates throughout the game, making small talk with Baro during pauses. Lorenzo can admit when he fails and praised Isagi and Hiori's chemistry that gave Bastard MÃ¼nchen the victory. He has an admiration for Kaiser as his long rival and his man-marking can come off as stalking. Lorenzo was overjoyed at Kaiser's Magnus goal and declared it a masterpiece that was worth 500 million.

    He also has a habit of saying "okay" after every sentence.
